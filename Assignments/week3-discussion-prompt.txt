In 2008 Chris Anderson wrote a provocative article in Wired magazine questioning whether science has moved into a new way of knowing about the world, where theory was no longer central to understanding and decisions, but data and algorithms alone could provide insights.

Do you think we have come to the end of theory? If so, what does this mean for scientific research and discover in theory-heavy fields such as the social sciences? If not, what does theory provide which data and algorithms alone cannot? 

Practically speaking, theory will not come to an end. Theory is the starting point of human inquiry and curiosity, and curiosity is an essential component of human nature and the human experience. So even if data and algorithms were to entirely replace existing processes of scientific inquiry, “theory” as a practice – even on the most casual level – will never cease to exist as a practice or way of life.

Moreover, theory is and will remain a critical to scientific inquiry and acquisition of human knowledge. Theory frames and contextualizes existing schools of thought, and thus it serves as an indispensable vantage point for further study.

Anderson is correct in pointing out that models can be flawed oversimplifications of reality, but these flaws and oversimplifications are not intended to adequately reflect truth and reality for all of time. Rather, theory provides a framework for thinking about and understanding the world, until a superior or more nuanced theory comes along. Theory is thus a tool for scientists – it serves as a framework for thinking within which scientists can ask questions, challenge, and contextualize existing knowledge. It’s possible that human discovery would occur with less frequency if scientists did not begin with a framework to which they could anchor their thoughts.
